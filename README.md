League of Legends:  Mastery Calculator
======================================

This project was designed to experiment with the new mastery changes that came
with season 2. After that, is has been updated for season 3.
Based on this tree, a custom one has been created with some new masteries and features.
It features a very fast interface with fully functional talent trees that work as you would expect in
game. Each point you change will automatically alter the URL to provide a unique
link so that you may share a build with other players. The calculator does not
rely on any server technology, and thus may be saved and used offline if
desired.

This Fork
---------

This fork of the project was written by Batiste Roger.
The new features are : New Mastery ideas (see data.js), the ability to add new Mastery icons (one by one) and the ability to add two mutualy exclusive masteries on the top line of each tree.
